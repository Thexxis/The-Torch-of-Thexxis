Weekly Game Jam 168 "Pass the Torch" Theme

The Torch of Thexxis is a small Zelda-like game made entirely in the Godot Game Engine.
A lot of the basic functionality was made following a Godot Tutorial by YouTuber FornClakes, although
there had to be a lot of patching up to bring things up to date with Godot 3.2.3 stable.
